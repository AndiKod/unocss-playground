# UnoCSS :Playground

Just a vanilla [Vite](https://vitejs.dev) template as a starting point, with [UnoCSS](https://unocss.antfu.me). It's a playground to experiment with the included tools and [presets](https://github.com/unocss/unocss/tree/main/packages) or community made ones, like [Scalpel](https://github.com/macheteHot/unocss-preset-scalpel).

## Quick Install

```
git clone https://github.com/AndiKod/unocss-playground.git myUno
cd myUno
yarn
yarn dev
yarn build  // Will build into /dist
```
